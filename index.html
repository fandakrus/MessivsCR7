        <h2>Event Information</h2>
        <p>For the past two decades, we have been in awe of two football legends. Unfortunately, all good things must
            come to an end. Let us come together as the football community to witness one final showdown, where a team
            chosen by Lionel Messi will face off against a team selected by Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="event-info" id="event-schedule-text">
        <h2>Event Schedule</h2>
        <p>The timing of this event will be contingent upon the retirement of one of these football greats. We must be
            prepared and eagerly await the opportunity to make it happen. The moment one of these GOATs retires, it will
            be the ideal time for this event to take place.

    <div class="event-info" id="event-location-text">
        <h2>Event Location</h2>
        <p>Regardless of where these football legends were born, there is likely a place on Earth where everyone wants
            to see a match like this. Unfortunately, as of now there is no inflatable stadium to accommodate such a
            large event, so we will have to search for the largest stadium available.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="event-info" id="event-location-tasks">
        <h2>How to make it happen?</h2>
        <p>To bring this sporting event to fruition, we need the entire football community to come together and show
            support. As passionate football fans, you can help by signing <a
                href="https://petitions.sumofus.org/petitions/messi-vs-ronaldo-farewell">this petition</a>. The more
            people who sign, the easier it will be to convince the powers that be to make this match a reality.
